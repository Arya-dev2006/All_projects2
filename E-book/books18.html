<h2>Author:J.D. Salinger</strong><br><br>

Summary:</h2>
<h3>"The Catcher in the Rye" by J.D. Salinger is a coming-of-age novel narrated by Holden Caulfield, a disillusioned and alienated teenager. The story begins with Holden's expulsion from prep school and follows his journey through New York City over the course of a few days.<br><br>

Holden struggles with the phoniness he perceives in the adult world, often feeling disconnected and cynical about society. Throughout the novel, he grapples with themes of identity, authenticity, and the loss of innocence.<br><br>

Holden's encounters with various characters, including his younger sister Phoebe, an old friend named Sally Hayes, and a prostitute named Sunny, highlight his longing for genuine human connection amidst his feelings of isolation.<br><br>

The title of the novel is derived from Holden's fantasy of being a "catcher in the rye," a guardian who saves children from falling off a cliff while playing in a field of rye. This metaphor symbolizes Holden's desire to protect innocence and preserve the purity of childhood.<br><br>

As the story unfolds, Holden's emotional turmoil and inner conflicts gradually come to the surface, culminating in a moment of self-realization and acceptance. Through his introspective narration, readers gain insight into the complexities of adolescence and the universal struggle to find one's place in the world.
