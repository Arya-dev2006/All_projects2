Summary:</h2>
<h3>"To Kill a Mockingbird" by Harper Lee is a timeless classic set in the fictional town of Maycomb, Alabama, during the 1930s. The story is narrated by Jean Louise "Scout" Finch, a young girl growing up alongside her brother Jem and their widowed father, Atticus Finch, a lawyer.<br>

1. **The Trial of Tom Robinson**: The central plotline revolves around the trial of Tom Robinson, a black man accused of raping Mayella Ewell, a white woman. Despite overwhelming evidence of Tom's innocence, the deeply ingrained racism of the townspeople leads to an unjust conviction.<br><br>
